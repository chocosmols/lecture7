            <p class="right-text">Gin tries to remain positive and optimistic despite his situation. While he warms up to people easily, he can occasionally be sarcastic or blunt to them. Gin is rarely melancholy. He gets attached to those he meets easily. He becomes especially attached to Sara, viewing her as a trustworthy and kind big sister figure. While he may be young, Gin always attempts his best to help the group by finding clues and remains strong despite the circumstances. He ends the majority of his sentences with "meow" and "woof", and tends to casually nickname those around him.</p>

            <p class="right-text">Gin is autistic, which explains some of his traits. For example, he has shown verbal stims by putting "meow" and "woof" at the end of his sentences, has comfort objects such as Mew-chan and his clothes, and is hyper-fixated on animals.

                Gin's unwillingness to go out without his usual attire might indicate sensory processing disorder, which is often present within neurodivergent people: the discomfort from wearing uncomfortable clothes might even cause physical pain in these individuals, making them act tense in social situations. Besides that, autistic people tend to feel nervous and exposed while wearing clothes that reveal too much skin, which is associated with the desire to avoid getting touched by unwanted stimuli. Certain body parts (commonly shoulders, neck, arms, and back) are usually more sensitive, which can be seen in Gin wearing extra clothes that cover his upper body parts (such as head, mouth, neck, spine, and hands). On the other hand, autistic individuals have reported enjoyment when touching soft fabric, which could explain Gin's attachment to Mew-chan.</p>
