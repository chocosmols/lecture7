            <p class="right-text">Sara Chidouin (千堂院チドウイン 紗良サラ, Chidouin Sara?) is the protagonist of Your Turn to Die, and a second-year student at Sonobeno High School.</p>

            <p class="right-text">Sara is described by her fellow participants as "strong and dependable" on more than one occasion. Her samurai-like attitude, as well as her tendency to take charge and adopt responsibility, prove she is a trustworthy and dependable ally. As a result, she's admired especially by the younger players in the Death Game and is often referred to as 'Big Sis Sara' by Gin Ibushi.

                While Sara is a key player in the Death Game, she suffers from self-doubt and often believes that she is not as competent as the others believe. At times, she is plagued with selfish thoughts about saving herself and sacrificing other contestants for her safety, but recovers and continues her conviction to save everyone.
                
                Additionally, while Sara can distrust or doubt some of the other participants, she continues to remain mature and, for the most part, cooperates well with the other players, staying dedicated to her goal to vanquish the Death Game.</p>

            <p class="right-text">Although Sara is deeply invested in others' needs, she often feels immense pressure because of them. During the third sub-game, she experiences a panic attack in the library while reminding herself of her goal to lead everyone to safety. Sara later breaks down crying, unsure whether it's worth continuing to live given the mental toll the Death Game has had on her.

                During the simulations run by ASU-NARO before the events of the Death Game, it was found that if Sara doesn't have anyone to support her, she will become obsessed with survival to the point where she only cares for herself. She was also able to use the others' deaths as a manipulation tool, granting her even more sway over her fellow players.</p>
